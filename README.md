it is a folder about what've learned about php. 
I've never learned html and php before. So every week, I took a long time on studying the basic information about the 
html and php knowledge. Meanwhile I took a huge time on practicing and getting to know about html and php (here are a lot of simple and easy codes in my files, however it really takes me a long time to learn and manage that)

There are alot of .md files in my practice for which records what I have learned and what notes I have made. You can read that if you want. 

Our project doesn't have high requirement for the php and back-end. But I still learn the back-end knowledge and try to use back-end to help our team. 

Even though I really learn very slowly, but I enjoyed learning new knowledge. Thank you very much.
